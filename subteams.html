					<h1 class="title"><div class="square"></div> What is buggy?</h1>
					<p class="text">Equal parts sport and engineering challenge, buggy is one of CMU’s most prominent and long standing traditions. There’s a role for everyone, whether as a pusher sprinting up one of the course hills, a driver speeding around the chute turn, or a mechanic designing and building a buggy from scratch. A year of team effort culminates in Raceday, the annual competition of the five-hill relay around campus. Whatever role suits you best, we can’t wait to see you on the course!</p>

					<h1 class="title"><div class="square"></div> Drivers</h1>
					<p class="text">Are you shorter than 5 feet? Do you want to ride at over 35 mph while inches from the ground? Then driving is for you! Driving is a fun and thrilling experience. With controls over the steering and the brake, it is up to the drivers to keep the buggy on the fastest path.</p>

					<h1 class="title"><div class="square"></div> Pushers</h1>
					<p class="text">Pushers . . . push the buggy. They are the ones who get it up the hills during the race. It requires a surprising mix of speed, strength, and coordination, making it a great work out and way to stay in shape while having fun.</p>

					<p class="text">Our mechanics design, build, and maintain our buggy fleet. You can usually find us either at shop hours building and fixing the buggies or at rolls preparing for the races! While this year may look a little different, we’ll still be keeping our buggies in top shape and hosting mechanic social events to stay connected. Reach out or drop by shop hours to learn more!</p>
